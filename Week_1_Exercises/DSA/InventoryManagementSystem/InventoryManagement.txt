o	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories ?
=> 1.Efficiency: Large inventories involve managing vast amounts of data. Efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial for quick search, insertion, and deletion operations, preventing performance bottlenecks.
2.Accuracy: Correct data management is vital for accurate inventory levels, preventing stockouts or overstocks.
3.Decision Making: Effective data handling enables generating reports and insights for informed decision-making about product ordering, pricing, and storage.


o	Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
=> Suitable data structures:
1.HashMap (or Dictionary): Ideal for quick lookup of products based on their productId.
2.ArrayList (or Array): Suitable for storing products sequentially, especially if frequent iterations over the entire inventory are required.
3.Tree-based structures (e.g., TreeMap): For scenarios where products need to be sorted based on specific criteria (e.g., price, name) and efficient search, insertion, and deletion are required.
